# NextJS + React Tweet Gallery

This project is a complete redesign of the Angular/.NET version I made in January.
It serves as a project to learn React + NextJS (With tailwindCSS) to produce a usable website.

Again much like the previous version, Twitter still refuses to implement core features to the V2 api such as fetching homepage timelines (where you see tweets from people you follow) and resolving video urls from media tweets.

This readme will be replaced at some point with more information
